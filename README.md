# What is lernOS?
**lernOS** is an **operating system** for **livelong learning** and **learning organizations**. It can be used by individuals, teams, and organizations. lernOS fosters the right **mindset**, trains the right **skills** and provides the right **tools** for the **digital connected knowledge society of the 21st century**.

lernos in **Esperanto** is the future tense of the verb "to learn" (mi lernos: I will learn, ni lernos: WE will learn). The uppercase "OS" stands for **"operating system"** like iOS, MacOS and CentOS. Simply put **lernOS is a framework to unleash the potential learning for individuals, teams and organizations** (profit and non-profit).

The **core of lernOS** is based on principles from [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done), [Objective Key Results](https://www.oreilly.com/business/free/files/introduction-to-okrs.pdf), and [Working Out Loud](https://workingoutloud.com/en/circle-guides/). If you practice one of these methods separately you can use the **lernOS Canvas** for **visual documentation**, **storytelling**, and to **expand your approach** over time.
