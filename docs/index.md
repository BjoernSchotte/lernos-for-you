lernOS for individuals is a self-management method for people living and working in the 21st century. To be successful in this century you have to learn, organize, and develop yourself on an ongoing basis. No matter if you are a teenager, a student, a young professional, a senior expert, a manager, or leader. lernOS brings together the best elements from existing methods (a big THANK YOU to all creators and contributors) to learn these 21st century skills:

* **[Objectives & Key Results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) (OKR):** a method developed by Andy Grove and John Doerr to manage objectives and laser-sharp focus in what we do.
* **[Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com) (GTD):** a method developed by David Allen to handle all the stuff and information overload we have to deal with on a daily basis.
* **[Working Out Loud](https://workingoutloud.com) (WOL):** a method coined by Bryce Williams and enriched by John Stepper to systematically network with people that might help us achieving our objectives.

If you have never heard of the three methods above you should start by reading about them to get a first overview. If you decide to start using lernOS the suggested way is to find 3-4 other people and become a peer support group called a "lernOS Circle". Decide when to start and meet for one hour in a so called "lernOS Sprint". Use the predefined agendas for the "lernOS Weekly" in this guide. Do a retrospective after the sprint and decide if you want to run another sprint with the same circle members.

Download the lernOS Guide and get started now! You find the recordings of the monthly lernOS Webcasts below. If you need support with finding circle members you can use the free [Circlefinder App](http://circlefinder.app/). If you are unsure or have any further questions you can join the [lernOS User Group](https://t.me/lernos) on Telegram or write with the hashtag [#lernOS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lernOS) on Twitter.

The adoption of lernOS isn't a matter of hours or days but of months or years. So Keep Calm & Learn On!
