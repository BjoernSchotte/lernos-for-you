# Getting Started
We live and work in a world of constant change. With trends like globalization, digitization, and urbanization the so called VUCA world emerged. [VUCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity) stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity as described in a study by James A. Lawrence in 1991. In such an environment theories, principles, and tools for management and self-management from the 20th century have to be updated for the digital connected knowledge society of the 21st century. In his book [Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us) Daniel Pink outlined that change in 140 characters: "Carrots & Sticks are so last century. We need to upgrade to autonomy, mastery and purpose".

This is true for individuals and organizations (for-profit and non-profit). To be successful in a VUCA world you have to practice a workstyle of "self-directed lifelong learning". You have to acquire new (digital) skills and also get used to new (digital) tools. To be successful as an organization you have to become a "learning organization". A learning organization [according to David Garvin](https://hbr.org/2008/03/is-yours-a-learning-organization) is an organization skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge, and at modifying its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights.

In terms of learning not all knowledge has to be created from scratch, not every wheel has to be reinvented and not all mistakes have to be repeated. If you have an open mindset an connect with others inside and outside your organization you will be [standing on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants). Consultancy [McKinsey found](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-rise-of-the-networked-enterprise-web-20-finds-its-payday) that a fully networked enterprise in contrast to companies working in silos internally and externally has a benefit of over 30%. So working in an open and connected way seems to be good for you and your organization at the same time.

The [digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation) enables new ways of working and new ways of learning. Digital transformation means that products, processes, and business models are digitized (e.g. transition vinyl record/compact disc/spotify, Airbnb as hotel company without buildings, Uber as taxi company without cars). To make use of this new possibilities digital skills have to be acquired by everybody. These skills can be learned with new methods like [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), [Personal Knowledge Mastery](https://jarche.com/pkm/) [Scrum](https://www.scrumguides.org/), [Holacracy](https://www.holacracy.org/constitution), and [Working Out Loud](https://workingoutloud.com/)(TM). One example: at the german engineering company Bosch 98% of employees practicing WOL(TM) say that the method helps to improve digital skills and support cultural change. You don't have to be a digital native to learn these skills. Everybody can learn them one small stepp at a time.

lernOS will help you and your organization to develop necessary [21st century skills](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy) like problem-solving, communication, creativity, and collaboration. You can use lernOS on your own or together with 3-4 other people in a [peer support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_support) group called lernOS Circle.
