# Getting Started
We live and work in a world of constant change. With trends like globalization, digitization, urbanization, connectivity and the knowledge society the so called VUCA world emerged as described in a study by James A. Lawrence in 1991. [VUCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity) stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. In such an environment management theories, principles, and tools of the 20th century have to be updated for the digital connected knowledge society of the 21st century. In his book [Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us) Danie Pink outlined that change in 140 characters: "Carrots & Sticks are so last century. We need to upgrade to autonomy, mastery and purpose".

This is true for individuals and organizations (for-profit and non-profit) at the same time. To be successful in a VUCA world you have to practice a workstyle of "self-directed lifelong learning". To be successful as an organization you have to become a "learning organization" which is [according to David Garvin](https://hbr.org/2008/03/is-yours-a-learning-organization) an organization skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge, and at modifying its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights.

In terms of learning you do not have to create all knowledge by yourself, reinvent every wheel or make mistakes others made before. If you have an open mindset an connect with others within and outside your organization you will be [standing on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants). Consultancy [McKinsey found](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-rise-of-the-networked-enterprise-web-20-finds-its-payday) that a fully networked enterprise in contrast to companies working in silos internally and externally has a benefit of over 30%. So working in an open and connected way seems to be good for you and your organization at the same time.

The [digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation) enables learning and sharing across existing silos. Digital transformation means that products, processes, and business models will be digitized. In other words: everything that that can be digitized will be digitized. The transition from vinyl record to compact disc to spotify is one such example. Business modells like Airbnb (hotel company without hotels) and Uber (taxi company without cars) are others. To make use of this new possibilities besides new learning and networking skills also the digital skills have to be improved on all levels. These skills can be learned with new methods like [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), [Objective Key Results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR), [Scrum](https://www.scrumguides.org/), [Holacracy](https://www.holacracy.org/constitution), and [Working Out Loud](https://workingoutloud.com/)(TM). One example: at the german engineering company Bosch 98% of employees practicing Working Out Loud(TM) said the method helps to improve digital skills and support cultural change.

lernOS will help you to develop these necessary [21st century skills](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy) like problem-solving, communication, creativity, and collaboration on the individual level (lernOS(mi)). You can use lernOS(mi) just on your own or in a [peer support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_support) group called lernOS Circle together with 3-4 other people. In the future there will be an lernOS(ni) version as well that uses principles from OKR to connect individual, team, and organizational level.
