# Circle Moderator  Checklist

**Week 0: Sprint Planning & Get Together**

When you are new to the circle you will get to know each other in week 0. You will plan when to meet, which tools to use and who is the moderator is.

* **Check-in:** Welcome Everybody! _(5 minutes)_
* **Get together:** Who are you? Introduce yourself. Five minute timebox per Circle member. _(25 minutes)_

* **Check-out:** Confirm the next meeting. _(5 minutes)_

Define a circle moderator who cares for event and time management. The moderator is not the "boss" of the circle but just a normal member that cares for smooth operation. Define which of the learing paths you will use. Define the day and time of your weekly circle meeting. Define if you meet face-to-face or virtually . Define the tools you use for communication and documentation in the circle. Decide which exercises from the suggested agenda you plan to do in the circle. Also decide if you want to use the lernOS Canvas (see chapter lernOS Canvas) as supporting tool.

* **Circle moderator:** ...
* **Learning path:** WOL / OKR / GTD
* **Day & time of weekly meeting:** ...
* **Weekly meetings are:** face-to-face / virtual
* **Tools used in circle:** ...
* **Do we use the Canvas:** yes / no

**ProTip:** everybody should do the Katas "Design Your Future Backwards" and "Think visual with the lernOS Canvas" in week 0 to find the right objectives for the lernOS Sprint.

**ProTip:** in a lot of circles the timebox for running an exercise in the Weekly is too short. You should use the method [inverted classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom). Every circle member prepares the exercises as "homework" upfront so you will have more time to discuss results in the circle.
