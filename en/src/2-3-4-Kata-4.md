### Organize - Build Lists & Contexts (Kata)

_**Duration:** 60-120 hours depending on reading speed and deepening urge_

When organizing your tasks with GTD you have a lot of possibilities to 
individualize. But also a minimal set of lists and contexts will support you to keep the overview.

-   Read Chapter 7 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things
    Done\".

-   Choose the list types you want to use (minimum: project list, action
    list, calendar and wait-for list). Important but non-essential lists
    are reference material, one-day/maybe, support material for actions,
    support material for projects.

-   Define the contexts you want to use (e.g.: \@Home,
    \@Work, \@Unterwegs, \@Besorgungen, \@Internet, \@Anruf, next
    action, \@Lesen).

An example: Do you commute regularly by train to work and back? Then you
can easily filter by contexts \@travel and \@read and only get those tasks that make sense when commuting.

**ProTip:** At the beginning, less is more. Start with a few but essential things. In the iteration phases (from week 8) the things you are missing are automatically added.
