### Stretch Goals and Moonshots (Kata)

**Learn the meaning of \"Strech Goals\" for setting challenging goals.**

_**Duration:** 15 minutes_

Strech Goals or Moonshot OKRs (derived from Kennedy\'s Moonshot Goal
1962) are objectives that seem impossible to achieve. For exampleinstead of asking yourself \"How do I get 10% better/faster?\" ask \"How do I
get better/faster by a factor of 10\". This forces you to leave your
comfort zone and think about other practices, skills and other know-how.

Look at your objectives and think about which you could transform into Moonshot OKRs
from and what the consequences would be for you. If you want to try
Moonshot OKRs, decide whether you want to customize the OKRs for this sprint or
a following sprint.
