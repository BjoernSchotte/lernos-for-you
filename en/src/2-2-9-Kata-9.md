### What is your Confidence Level? (Kata)

**How sure are you that you will reach your OKRs?**

_**Duration:** 15 minutes_

According to Henrik-Jan van der Pol by perdoo the [OKR Confidence
Level](https://www.perdoo.com/blog/okr-confidence-levels/) shows how much you believe that the OKR is (still) achievable. Henrik-Jan proposes
the three levels \"on-track\", \"off-track\" and \"at-risk\". The estimate of an OKD confidence level is also presented by Christina Wodtke in the book Introduction to
[OKRs.](https://www.oreilly.com/business/free/files/introduction-to-okrs.pdf) She recommends a scale of 1-10, with a 1 saying \"a miracle would have
to happen\" and a 10 \"Yeah, I can do that\".

Check out the two sources and decide if you also want to have
confidence levels for your OKRs. If so, consider where and when to put
them in your documentation.
