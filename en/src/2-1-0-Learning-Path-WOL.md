## WOL Learning Path

Sharing your knowledge openly and profiting from the knowledge of others helps that not everyone has to reinvent the wheel over and over again. According to the [Working Out Loud method](https://workingoutloud.com/en/circle-guides) by John Stepper, you can

1. Learn To set your own learning goal for the sprint.
2. Identify people and communities that are related to your goal.
3. Publish contributions and show appreciation to build a network in a systematic and goal-oriented way.
4. Use the support of your new network to achieve your goals faster and easier.

This learning path is a shortened to 11 exercises version of the circle method by John Stepper (31 exercises). However, the basic idea "Working Out Loud = Observable Work + Narrating Your Work" [by Bryce Williams](https://thebryceswrite.com/2010/11/29/when-will-we-work-out-loud-soon/) remains.
