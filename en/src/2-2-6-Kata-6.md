\"tool-agnostic\". This means that you can practice GTD independently of
special software or apps. Similarly for OKRs paper and pencil are enough,
yet many practitioners use digital tools for it. Check out examples of
OKR tools this week and decide if you want to use them:

-   **Texteditors**, e.g. Microsoft Word, Google Doc

-   **Note taking applications**, such as Microsoft OneNote, Evernote

-   **To-do list tools**, e.g. Trello, Microsoft To-Do, Microsoft
    Planner, Jira

-   **Wikis**, e.g. Mediawiki, Confluence, TiddlyWiki, Etherpad

-   **Enterprise OKR-Tools**, e.g. 7Geese, WeekDone, Workpath
