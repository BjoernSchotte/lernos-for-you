## OKR Learning Path

Set yourself ambitious goals (objectives) and define tangible results
(key results) can be very motivating. Many people have a long
someday-maybe-list, but they don\'t get things done. The longer the
list, the bigger the hurdle to start. Google therefore uses the simple
Objectives & Key Results (OKR) method, which defines the goals for
next three months according to the [following
criteria:](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/)

-   Objectives are ambitious and may feel somewhat uncomfortable.

-   Key results are measurable on a scale from 0 - 1.0 (or 0-100%).

-   OKRs are transparent so everyone can see what others are working on.

-   The “sweet spot” for an OKR grade is 60% – 70%; if someone consistently fully attains their objectives, their OKRs aren’t ambitious enough and they need to think bigger.
    
-   Low grades should be viewed as learning opportunities to help refine the next OKRs.
    
-   In companies, OKRs are NOT(!) synonymous with employee evaluations.
    
-   OKRs are not a shared to-do list.

With the following Katas, you can learn OKRs for setting your own goals
in a sprint. It doesn\'t matter if you\'re in an organization or a
company that\'s already using OKR, or whether you\'re just using OKRs
for yourself.
