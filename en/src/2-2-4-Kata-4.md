**Check your OKRs for the sprint and freeze it.**

_**Duration:** 30 minutes_

You\'ve had a few nights to rethink your OKRs. Do you feel comfortable
and motivated by it? Do the objectives feel demanding? Do you see a
realistic chance of achieving the key results at 60-70%. Rethink your
OKRs and set yourself up for this sprint. Document the
OKRs in the OKR environment.
