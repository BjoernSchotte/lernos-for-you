### Projects - Become like the kids (Kata)

_**Duration:** 60-180 minutes depending on reading speed, number of projects & project size_

Projects have their own definition in GTD. Anything that takes
**more than one step** to be completed AND that can be done within a year is called
a project. Projects are more complex tasks that run in sequence or in parallel. Therefore it is important to get an idea of the target state and to go through the whole project at the
beginning.

-   Read Chapter 3 und10 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things Done\".
    
-   Work through a new or existing project according to these rules and
    transfer the results to your GTD system.
