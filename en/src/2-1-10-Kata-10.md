### Update Your Digital Twin (Kata)

In this kata you will check if your digital twins like website, blog or profile do match your wishes and if not you will go out and update them.

_**Duration:** 20 minutes_

Does your main digital twin represent you in the way you want to? A lot of people register for an account in a social network and never think about updating their profile. You should keep your profile up to date and have a look at it on a regular basis (e.g. have a recurring task every three month). The facts about you, current projects and interests should be visible on that profile.

Check in the online profile if you have a nice image, a short description, and a slogan. List the improvements you want to make:
