Google recommends that OKRs to measure key results always on a scale of
0-1.0. In his [Beginners Guide to OKR,](https://felipecastro.com/resource/The-Beginners-Guide-to-OKR.pdf) Felipe Castro describes some of the drawbacks of this approach under the heading \"Forget Scoring\":

-   The rating on the scale from 0 - 1.0 is very subjective

-   If you want to define per key resultin advance, what 0.3,
    0.7 etc. means, the complexity of the process increases

Therefore Felipe recommends using value-based key
results and measuring them easily. In his opinion this simplifies the
process of defining OKRs for oneself and also for teams.

Check out your key results and consider whether the process would be
simplified for you by simply measuring instead of scoring on the 0-1.0
scale. Choose an approach and adjust your key results if necessary.
