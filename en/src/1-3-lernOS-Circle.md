## lernOS Circle: The Power Of Peer Support
If you do not want to practice lernOS on your own you can do it in a group of 4-5 people called a learning circle. A circle is a [peer support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_support) group in which members help each other with feedback, experience, knowledge, and reflection. The circle is a circle of trust: what happens in the circle stays in the circle! The circle members will have a weekly meeting with a standard agenda to structure the learning and development process.

A learning circle meets once a week. Each meeting has a standardized agenda with a check-in, suggested exercises called lernOS Katas (see appendix for the weekly agendas and the exercise descriptions), and a check-out. The timebox for the weekly can be adopted to the needs of the circle members, suggested timeslot is Friday between 11-12am.

**ProTip:** Kata is just another term for exercise. It comes from practicing programming skills in a peer learning format. Read more about this format at [codekata.com](http://codekata.com).

The weekly meeting can be face-to-face or virtual. The circle has to define tools for communication and documentation between the meetings. The following tools have proven to work in practice:

* Microsoft Teams
* OneNote
* SharePoint
* Skype
* Skype for Business
* Slack
* WebEx
* WhatsApp
* Yammer
* Zoom

If you have an Enterprise Social Network (ESN) like Jive or Connections in your organization that might also be a good option to support lernOS Circles.

**ProTip:** To have a good usability choose a tool that supports communication and documentation, e.g. [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software). In Microsoft Teams you can use the channel "General" for chat-based communication, the audio/video conferencing feature for virtual meetings and a OneNote Notebook for documentation.
