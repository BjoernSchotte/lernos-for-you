### Doing (Kata)

_**Duration:** 2-4 hours depending on reading speed_

At this stage, we choose what to do. Two basic principles will support
you in this.

-   **Four criteria for completing tasks**. Filtering tasks by
    context/time/energy/priority.

-   **The three-stage model for evaluating daily work**. Division
    into the three types of work (define tasks, predefined tasks,
    unplanned tasks).

-   Read Chapter 9 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things Done\" (without the 6-step model) 
    
-   Choose the day that you want to consciously work on the complete phase

-   Consider all three types of work for your scheduling

    -   Plan time for several daily reviews (overview)

    -   Schedule time for \"Organize and Process\"

    -   Schedule time for completing scheduled tasks (enter appointments
        with yourself in the calendar)

    -   Schedule time for completing unplanned tasks (leave room in the
        calendar)

-   Your day is planned - Then get an overview of the upcoming tasks and
    get going

**ProTip:** Your calendar day should NEVER be fully planned. 20% buffer
for unplanned tasks is a good rule of thumb.

**ProTip:** When you make appointments with others always plan **5 minutes
less** (e.g.: 25 instead of 30 minutes or 55 instead of 60 minutes)-
