## GTD Learning Path

Organizing and optimizing yourself and your way of working can be very motivating. Many people today face the problem of being in the hamster wheel of daily and
routine activities not having time for value-adding things, let alone thinking about where they want to develop in the medium or long term.

All elements of GTD have been used successfully for a long time. David Allen has compiled and combined some of these methods in a way that the sum is greater than the parts.

GTD is a way to create the space in our VUCA world to make us fit for the future.

**The challenge:** You must have read the [book](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3492307205/ref=as_li_tl) to really understand GTD.

**The solution:** By gradually understanding the rules and principles, as well as practicing it (Katas) within the next 13 weeks, you understand the overall context and build up your individual GTD-system.
