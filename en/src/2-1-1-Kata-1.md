### Design Your Future Backwards (Kata)

**Design your future by reflecting on present and past and creating your personal vision (30 Minutes)**

This kata is based on the method [The Future, Backwards](https://cognitive-edge.com/methods/the-future-backwards/) by Dave Snowden. The kata i	s used to get a better overview of the bigger picture by looking in the past and the possible futures. The horizon of focus for the kata can be short-term (1-2 years), medium-term (3-5 years) or long-term (whole life).

**Instruction:**

1. Prepare your Future Backwards Canvas ([example](https://cognitive-edge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/3---ChrisFl-IMG-0058-wpcf_300x225.jpg)). This can be a landscape piece of paper with a "Y" on it rotated by 90 degrees to the right indicating the present (current state), the past, the vision (heaven), the antivision (hell) and the stairway to heaven. Define the timespan you want to look back and forth (short-/medium-/long-term) (5 Minutes)
2. Describe the current state in 3-5 short phrases (5 Minutes)
3. Describe the 3-5 key events in the past that led to the current state (5 Minutes)
4. Describe your vision in 3-5 short phrases (5 Minutes)
5. Describe your anti-vision in 3-5 short phrases (5 Minutes)
6. Describe the 3-5 key events that need to happen to make your vision come true and avoid your anti-vision (5 Minutes)
