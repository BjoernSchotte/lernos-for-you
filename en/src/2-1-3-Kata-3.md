### My Objective For The Next 12 weeks (Kata)

In this kata you choose your objective for the sprint. 

_**Duration:** 25 minutes_

What do you want to accomplish in the next 12 weeks? Pick an objective that you really, really care about and you can make progress towards in the sprint. You will use Google's OKR method to define that objective. For the NOOB path it's not prio 1 to achieve the objective. Core is to learn how to achieve objectives more easy with the help of an open workstyle and the development of a network.

Select an objective for the next 12 weeks. Use the questions "Do I really, really care?", "Can I achieve it in 12 weeks?", and "Can my network help me?" to test if the objective is appropriate for the sprint. If you have problems to find a good objective think about goals that support your roles, activities, or projects. If you want to help to make the world a better place you can also choose an objective that is related to the [United Nation's 17 sustainable development goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals).

Use the principles from objective & key results (OKR) to specify your objective. Define an objective and write it down below. To help you to track progress define 2-4 key results per objective. You should be able to measure the key results on a scale from 0.0-1.0. To make sure to set yourself ambitious goals a completion rate of 0.7 is regarded as a success.
