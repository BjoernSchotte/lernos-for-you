### Processing - The 2 minute rule (Kata)

_**Duration:** 60-90 minutes depending on reading speed and number of small items_

This week you will work your inbox and consistently apply the
2-minute rule: everything that can be done in less than 2 minutes is
done immediately.

-   Read Chapter 6 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things Done".
    
-   Take 10-15 minutes a day for \"small stuff\".

-   Work focused on everything from answering emails, appointments, tweets,
    likes, feedback, calls etc.

-   Unimportant stuff can be immediatly disposed (a Timer helps with
    timeboxing).
