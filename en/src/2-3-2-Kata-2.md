### Collect - Mind Sweep (Kata)

_**Duration:** 60-120 minutes depending on reading speed and number of \"loose ends\" in the head_

You\'re probably carrying a lot of things around with you in your head
and new items are coming in all the time. All these loose ends lower
your ability to focus and get things done. The following exercise will
help you to get free your head without loosing anything.

-   Read Chapter 5 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things
    Done\".

-   Now write down **everything** that goes through your mind. What to
    do now & soon? What needs to be donenow? Who is to call?

-   One page per idea or task (heading is sufficient).

-   Put each sheet in your inbox.

In this exercise, the mass counts. Don\'t stop until no more items are coming.
