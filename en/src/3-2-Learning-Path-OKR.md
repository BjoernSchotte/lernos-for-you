## OKR Learning Path

Set yourself ambitious goals (objectives) and define tangible results
(key results) can be very motivating. Many people have a long
someday-maybe-list, but they don\'t get things done. The longer the
list, the bigger the hurdle to start. Google therefore uses the simple
Objectives & Key Results (OKR) method, which defines the goals for
next three months according to the [following
criteria:](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/)

-   Objectives are ambitious and may feel somewhat uncomfortable.

-   Key results are measurable on a scale from 0 - 1.0 (or 0-100%).

-   OKRs are transparent so everyone can see what others are working on.

-   The “sweet spot” for an OKR grade is 60% – 70%; if someone consistently fully attains their objectives, their OKRs aren’t ambitious enough and they need to think bigger.
    
-   Low grades should be viewed as learning opportunities to help refine the next OKRs.
    
-   In companies, OKRs are NOT(!) synonymous with employee evaluations.
    
-   OKRs are not a shared to-do list.

With the following Katas, you can learn OKRs for setting your own goals
in a sprint. It doesn\'t matter if you\'re in an organization or a
company that\'s already using OKR, or whether you\'re just using OKRs
for yourself.

### Top 10 Sources of OKRs (Kata)

**Learn about the history and basics of Objectives & Key Results
(OKRs).**

_**Duration:** 60 minutes_

The history of OKRs goes back several decades. In 1975, John Doerr took
part in a training course at Intel in which Andy Grove explained the
theory of OKRs (book tip: [High Output
Management](https://amzn.to/2O9sA4u)). In 1999 John Doerr worked for the
venture capital company Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which had just
invested in the startup Google. That way the OKR method reached
Google. In the foreword of Doerr\'s book [Measure What Matters: OKRs:
The Simple Idea that Drives 10x Growth,](https://amzn.to/2XVI1Bv) Google
founder Larry Page describes the effect of OKRs as:

> OKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over. They\'ve
> helped make our crazily bold mission of \'organizing the world\'s
> information\' perhaps even achievable. They\'ve kept me and the rest
> of the company on time and on track when it mattered the most.

In the following, I have compiled some sources with which you can

### Set up your OKR environment (Kata)

**Plan time and space for your OKR process.**

_**Duration:** 30 minutes_

It doesn\'t take much for your personal OKR environment. You need to
schedule check-in time in the calendar each week (e.g. Monday
morning, 30 minutes). You also need a place to document your OKRs. This
can be analog (e.g. paper, whiteboard) or digital (e.g.
OneNote, Wiki). You have to decide whether or not to make your OKRs
public the first time. Keep in mind that the smaller the circle of
people who know your goals, the less can help you achieve your goals.

Define your OKR environment now:

-   **OKR Weekly Check-in (weekday, time):** \...

-   **OKR Documentation:** \...

### Define OKRs for your Sprint (Kata)

**Write down your objective and key results for this sprint in OKR
format.**

_**Duration:** 30 minutes_

In the last kata you (hopefully) learned a lot about the formulation of
OKRs. Now you can apply this to the planning for the running
sprint. To do this, use John Doer\'s OKR formula to formulate your objective:

*I want (objective): \...\...\.... as measured by \...\...\.... (Key
Results):*

Check your **objective** with the following criteria (source:
[Google):](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/set-objectives-and-develop-key-results/)

-   The objective is demanding and feels a bit uncomfortable.

-   The Objective uses phrases that trigger new activities (not: keep,
    continue).

-   The Objective uses phrases that describe an end state (e.g. \"climb
    the mountain\", \"ship feature Y\").

-   The Objective uses tangible and unambiguous terms. It should be
    clear to an outsider whether a goal has been achieved or not.

Check your **key results** against the following criteria:

-   Not more than three key results are defined per objective.

-   The key results express measurable milestones that bring you closer
    to the objective when you reach it.

-   The key results are measurable and can be measured on a scale of
    0.0 - 1.0 (or 0 - 100%).

-   The key results express results, not activities. The wording of a
    key result should not include words such as \"advice,\" \"help,\"
    \"analyze,\" or \"participate.\"

-   Measurable milestones should include proof of completion. And this
    evidence should be visible, credible and easily comprehensible.

### Finalize your OKRs for the Sprint (Kata)

**Check your OKRs for the sprint and freeze it.**

_**Duration:** 30 minutes_

You\'ve had a few nights to rethink your OKRs. Do you feel comfortable
and motivated by it? Do the objectives feel demanding? Do you see a
realistic chance of achieving the key results at 60-70%. Rethink your
OKRs and set yourself up for this sprint. Document the
OKRs in the OKR environment.

### Perform your Weekly Check-In (Kata)

**Start with a short OKR Weekly Check-In each week**

_**Duration:** 30 minutes_

With the OKR Weekly Check-in you can see your goals and the current
state on a weekly basis. This helps you not to lose focus and to identify and remove obstacles early.

You have already set the time of your check-in and added it as a regular date
in the calendar. Use the following questions for the OKR Weekly Check-in:

-   **Progress:** What has changed in key results since the last Weekly?

-   **Trust:** How sure am I to achieve the key results?

-   **Barriers:** What hinders my progress?

-   **Next steps:** What can I do to improve progress?

Use the next four weeks to make the check-in a weekly routine. Every week,
you\'ll learn about additional topics around OKRs in a small 15-minute
learning nugget.

### Tools for OKRs (Kata)

**Learn about some tools for OKRs.**

_**Duration:** 15 minutes_

David Allen often describes Getting Things Done (GTD) as
\"tool-agnostic\". This means that you can practice GTD independently of
special software or apps. Similarly for OKRs paper and pencil are enough,
yet many practitioners use digital tools for it. Check out examples of
OKR tools this week and decide if you want to use them:

-   **Texteditors**, e.g. Microsoft Word, Google Doc

-   **Spreadsheet**, e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets

-   **Note taking applications**, such as Microsoft OneNote, Evernote

-   **To-do list tools**, e.g. Trello, Microsoft To-Do, Microsoft
    Planner, Jira

-   **Wikis**, e.g. Mediawiki, Confluence, TiddlyWiki, Etherpad

-   **Enterprise OKR-Tools**, e.g. 7Geese, WeekDone, Workpath

### Scoring vs. Measuring Key Results (Kata)

**Understand the difference between \"scoring\" and \"measuring\" and
choose your path.**

_**Duration:** 15 minutes_

Google recommends that OKRs to measure key results always on a scale of
0-1.0. In his [Beginners Guide to OKR,](https://felipecastro.com/resource/The-Beginners-Guide-to-OKR.pdf) Felipe Castro describes some of the drawbacks of this approach under the heading \"Forget Scoring\":

-   The rating on the scale from 0 - 1.0 is very subjective

-   If you want to define per key resultin advance, what 0.3,
    0.7 etc. means, the complexity of the process increases

Therefore Felipe recommends using value-based key
results and measuring them easily. In his opinion this simplifies the
process of defining OKRs for oneself and also for teams.

Check out your key results and consider whether the process would be
simplified for you by simply measuring instead of scoring on the 0-1.0
scale. Choose an approach and adjust your key results if necessary.

### Stretch Goals and Moonshots (Kata)

**Learn the meaning of \"Strech Goals\" for setting challenging goals.**

_**Duration:** 15 minutes_

Strech Goals or Moonshot OKRs (derived from Kennedy\'s Moonshot Goal
1962) are objectives that seem impossible to achieve. For exampleinstead of asking yourself \"How do I get 10% better/faster?\" ask \"How do I
get better/faster by a factor of 10\". This forces you to leave your
comfort zone and think about other practices, skills and other know-how.

Look at your objectives and think about which you could transform into Moonshot OKRs
from and what the consequences would be for you. If you want to try
Moonshot OKRs, decide whether you want to customize the OKRs for this sprint or
a following sprint.

### What is your Confidence Level? (Kata)

**How sure are you that you will reach your OKRs?**

_**Duration:** 15 minutes_

According to Henrik-Jan van der Pol by perdoo the [OKR Confidence
Level](https://www.perdoo.com/blog/okr-confidence-levels/) shows how much you believe that the OKR is (still) achievable. Henrik-Jan proposes
the three levels \"on-track\", \"off-track\" and \"at-risk\". The estimate of an OKD confidence level is also presented by Christina Wodtke in the book Introduction to
[OKRs.](https://www.oreilly.com/business/free/files/introduction-to-okrs.pdf) She recommends a scale of 1-10, with a 1 saying \"a miracle would have
to happen\" and a 10 \"Yeah, I can do that\".

Check out the two sources and decide if you also want to have
confidence levels for your OKRs. If so, consider where and when to put
them in your documentation.

### Individual vs. Team/Organizational OKRs (Kata)

**Get to know the interaction of OKRs at the levels of the individual,
the team and the organization.**

_**Duration:** 30 minutes_

As well described in Rick Klau\'s [How Google sets goals:
OKRs](https://youtu.be/mJB83EZtAjc?t=1061) video, OKRs are not only defined at the individual level, but also at the level of teams,
departments, and the entire organization. In contrast to other target
agreement systems such as Management by
[Objectives](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_Objectives)
(MbO), however, this is not a top-down process, but both top-down
(recommendation John Doerr: 40%) and bottom-up (recommendation John
Doerr: 60%).

Consider whether you can use the method in your environment, such as
your team or department in addition to your personal OKRs. Consider at
least one try to test whether your environment is open to OKRs and
how to implement it there.

### OKR Review (Kata)

**Was your OKR cycle successful and what topics are for the next one?**

_**Duration:** 60 minutes_

In Scrum, the [Sprint Review](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-review) is used to check the results (increments) at the end of the sprint
(Inspect) and adjust them for the next sprint (Adapt) if necessary. In
Scrum, the review is different from the [Sprint Retrospective,](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-retro) which is about team interaction, not results.

Franziska Schneider from Workpath [suggests in a blog](https://www.workpath.com/magazine/wie-sie-einen-effektiven-okr-zyklus-gestalten/) to make a review at the end of an OKR cycle and ask yourself the following questions:

-   Was I successful with my OKRs?

-   What are the topics for the next OKR cycle?

-   Where can/should I present the results of the review?

Now perform an OKR review for the current sprint and document the
results.
