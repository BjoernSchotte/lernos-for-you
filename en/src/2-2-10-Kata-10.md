### Individual vs. Team/Organizational OKRs (Kata)

**Get to know the interaction of OKRs at the levels of the individual,
the team and the organization.**

_**Duration:** 30 minutes_

As well described in Rick Klau\'s [How Google sets goals:
OKRs](https://youtu.be/mJB83EZtAjc?t=1061) video, OKRs are not only defined at the individual level, but also at the level of teams,
departments, and the entire organization. In contrast to other target
agreement systems such as Management by
[Objectives](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_Objectives)
(MbO), however, this is not a top-down process, but both top-down
(recommendation John Doerr: 40%) and bottom-up (recommendation John
Doerr: 60%).

Consider whether you can use the method in your environment, such as
your team or department in addition to your personal OKRs. Consider at
least one try to test whether your environment is open to OKRs and
how to implement it there.
