### OKR Review (Kata)

**Was your OKR cycle successful and what topics are for the next one?**

_**Duration:** 60 minutes_

In Scrum, the [Sprint Review](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-review) is used to check the results (increments) at the end of the sprint
(Inspect) and adjust them for the next sprint (Adapt) if necessary. In
Scrum, the review is different from the [Sprint Retrospective,](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-retro) which is about team interaction, not results.

Franziska Schneider from Workpath [suggests in a blog](https://www.workpath.com/magazine/wie-sie-einen-effektiven-okr-zyklus-gestalten/) to make a review at the end of an OKR cycle and ask yourself the following questions:

-   Was I successful with my OKRs?

-   What are the topics for the next OKR cycle?

-   Where can/should I present the results of the review?

Now perform an OKR review for the current sprint and document the
results.
