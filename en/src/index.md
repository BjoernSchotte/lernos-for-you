# About lernOS

The verb "lernos" is the future tense of "learning" in the Esperanto language (mi lernos = I will learn, ni lernos = we will learn). **lernOS** is an **operating system** for **lifelong learning** and **learning organizations**. But lernOS is not software, it's "brainware". It is a way to think and act to be successful in the 21st century as an individual, a team or a whole organization.

There are **three guides** that describe the approach on the **individual level** (lernOS for You), the **team level** (lernOS for Teams), and the **organizational level** (lernOS for Organizations).  Additionally there is the **lernOS Toolbox** describing commonly used methods and tools (e.g. Podcasting, Expert Debriefing, Barcamps, Sketchnoting). lernOS is not invented on the green field but a compilation of existing and tested methods. All guides are available under the **open Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license** on the [lernOS Website](https://lernos.org). 

If you have **further questions** regarding lernOS or need **peer support** you can freely join the community platform [CONNECT](https://community.cogneon.de) and the [lernOS CircleFinder](https://community.cogneon.de/c/lernos/lernos-circlefinder) or write with [#lernOS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lernOS) on Twitter. The mastery of lernOS is a matter of months or years not hours or days. So **Keep Calm & Learn On!**

Yours @simondueckert
