### Set up your OKR environment (Kata)

**Plan time and space for your OKR process.**

_**Duration:** 30 minutes_

It doesn\'t take much for your personal OKR environment. You need to
schedule check-in time in the calendar each week (e.g. Monday
morning, 30 minutes). You also need a place to document your OKRs. This
can be analog (e.g. paper, whiteboard) or digital (e.g.
OneNote, Wiki). You have to decide whether or not to make your OKRs
public the first time. Keep in mind that the smaller the circle of
people who know your goals, the less can help you achieve your goals.
