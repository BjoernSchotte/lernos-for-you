### Work through the 5 phases (Kata)

_**Duration:** 120-240 minutes_

You have dealt intensively with the individual 5 phases of GTD in the
last 7 weeks. You\'ve got all the necessary materials, set up your
workplace, set up your individual system, prepared lists & contexts and
practiced the weekly review. And you know how to identify the next action.

Now in theory, you know everything you need to know to get the **whole
process going.** Every single phase in itself is important, but only as
a closed cycle the process will unfold its full potential for you.

You\'re ready! Starting this week, we\'ll get the whole system up and
running. Continue to work through the 5 phases of GTD this week.

**Initial - Desk Sweep**

-   Now you start to put everything around your workplace to a very
    simple exam. Take EVERY thing in your hand and ask The One Question:
    Can this be eliminated?

-   If so, dispose of it immediately, otherwise put it in your inbox.

-   Repeat this process until everything has gone through your slopes.
    Moreisnottodo.

-   Tip: Start locally (on the square) and expand your searches for
    stuff & things in a concentric way (desk surface, drawers, storage
    areas, cabinets, floors & shelves, etc.).

Then go through phases 1-5 iteratively again and again.
