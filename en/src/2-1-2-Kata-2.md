### Think visual with the lernOS Canvas (Kata)

A canvas is a visual structure that can be used to work through several building blocks in a systematic way. This way you use a canvas as a visual checklist. It can also be used to tell a complex story. The idea came from Alex Osterwalder who invented the [business model canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas). The lernOS Canvas uses the same basic structure as the business model canvas. But the names of the building blocks have been changed to reflect the topics a circle works on during a sprint.

The lernOS Canvas can be downloaded from the [lernOS Website](https://lernos.org) in different formats (e.g. PowerPoint, PDF, PNG). To be able to work with the canvas in an agile way one should NEVER write on a canvas ... that's why sticky notes were invented!

The header of the canvas contains the creation date, the number of the sprint, and a motivation/mission statement (if you have one). In the building block "My Objectives & Key Results" the goals for the current sprint are documented. The building blocks "My Roles", "My Activities", "My Projects", and "My Knowledge & Skills" can be used to identify potential objectives. "My Relationships" and "My Social Networks" can be used to identify people that can help you to achieve your objectives. Available resources (e.g. documents, checklists, videos etc.) are listed in "My Knowledge Assets". The repositories listed at "My Repositories" can be used to share assets generously with the network.
