## GTD Learning Path

Organizing and optimizing yourself and your way of working can be very motivating. Many people today face the problem of being in the hamster wheel of daily and
routine activities not having time for value-adding things, let alone thinking about where they want to develop in the medium or long term.

All elements of GTD have been used successfully for a long time. David Allen has compiled and combined some of these methods in a way that the sum is greater than the parts.

GTD is a way to create the space in our VUCA world to make us fit for the future.

**The challenge:** You must have read the [book](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3492307205/ref=as_li_tl) to really understand GTD.

**The solution:** By gradually understanding the rules and principles, as well as practicing it (Katas) within the next 13 weeks, you understand the overall context and build up your individual GTD-system.

### Get to know the basics (Kata)

_**Duration:** 120-180 minutes depending on reading speed, reading depth and available/missing materials_

The basics of GTD are documentary in many places on the Internet & in
literature. Get acquainted with the basics of GTD this week and create
an environment that puts you in an optimal situation. This environment
is based on the three pillars of time, location and tools.
ThePillarTimetreatwe later.

-   Read Chapters 1, 2 & 4 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things
    Done\"

-   Put your work material like storage baskets, pens, folders,
    sticky note slips together

-   Reposition your workspace(s) (Office, Home etc.)

**ProTip:** Minimize the number of your inbound baskets; 1x Office, 1x Home, 1x
electronic (e-mail).

**ProTip:** e-mails generally remain: in the e-mail system and are managed
digitally there.

**ProTip:** Forward and manage all other electronic inputs to the e-mail system.

**ProTip: **Often throwingsomething away.

**ProTip:** Active deactivation of newsletters, mail distributors, mailing
stations etc.

### Collect - Mind Sweep (Kata)

_**Duration:** 60-120 minutes depending on reading speed and number of \"loose ends\" in the head_

You\'re probably carrying a lot of things around with you in your head
and new items are coming in all the time. All these loose ends lower
your ability to focus and get things done. The following exercise will
help you to get free your head without loosing anything.

-   Read Chapter 5 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things
    Done\".

-   Now write down **everything** that goes through your mind. What to
    do now & soon? What needs to be donenow? Who is to call?

-   One page per idea or task (heading is sufficient).

-   Put each sheet in your inbox.

In this exercise, the mass counts. Don\'t stop until no more items are coming.

### Processing - The 2 minute rule (Kata)

_**Duration:** 60-90 minutes depending on reading speed and number of small items_

This week you will work your inbox and consistently apply the
2-minute rule: everything that can be done in less than 2 minutes is
done immediately.

-   Read Chapter 6 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things Done".
    
-   Take 10-15 minutes a day for \"small stuff\".

-   Work focused on everything from answering emails, appointments, tweets,
    likes, feedback, calls etc.

-   Unimportant stuff can be immediatly disposed (a Timer helps with
    timeboxing).

### Organize - Build Lists & Contexts (Kata)

_**Duration:** 60-120 hours depending on reading speed and deepening urge_

When organizing your tasks with GTD you have a lot of possibilities to 
individualize. But also a minimal set of lists and contexts will support you to keep the overview.

-   Read Chapter 7 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things
    Done\".

-   Choose the list types you want to use (minimum: project list, action
    list, calendar and wait-for list). Important but non-essential lists
    are reference material, one-day/maybe, support material for actions,
    support material for projects.

-   Define the contexts you want to use (e.g.: \@Home,
    \@Work, \@Unterwegs, \@Besorgungen, \@Internet, \@Anruf, next
    action, \@Lesen).

An example: Do you commute regularly by train to work and back? Then you
can easily filter by contexts \@travel and \@read and only get those tasks that make sense when commuting.

**ProTip:** At the beginning, less is more. Start with a few but essential things. In the iteration phases (from week 8) the things you are missing are automatically added.

### Review - The Weekly Review (Kata)

_**Duration:** 60-120 minutes depending on reading speed and deepening urge_

The review phase in GTD has a slightly different character than the
previous phases. It is mainly used to keep your system up to date and is
therefore the heart of the system. You will only be able to rely on your
system if you go through this phase regularly. In addition to regular brief views of your system, the weekly review is
at the heart of this phase.

-   Read Chapter 8 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things Done\".
    
-   Find a suitable date for the weekly review and enter it as a repeating
    event in your calendar (1-2 hours should be already).

-   Run through the weekly review once for the last week

    1.  **Everything** in the inbox which you haven\'t put there until
        then

    2.  Empty the inbox

    3.  **See** through next steps

    4.  Browse through the dates (did To-Do\'s come out of it ?)

    5.  See through upcoming dates (are To-Do\'s included for you in
        preparation for the appointment?)

    6.  Check the **Waiting-for-list**

    7.  Browse the **list of projects**

    8.  **Mind Sweeping**

**ProTip:** To make the weekly review as pleasant as possible, connect
it to things that are pleasant and fun for you. For example, your
favorite drink, favorite place, favorite music or your favorite time.

### Doing (Kata)

_**Duration:** 2-4 hours depending on reading speed_

At this stage, we choose what to do. Two basic principles will support
you in this.

-   **Four criteria for completing tasks**. Filtering tasks by
    context/time/energy/priority.

-   **The three-stage model for evaluating daily work**. Division
    into the three types of work (define tasks, predefined tasks,
    unplanned tasks).

-   Read Chapter 9 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things Done\" (without the 6-step model) 
    
-   Choose the day that you want to consciously work on the complete phase

-   Consider all three types of work for your scheduling

    -   Plan time for several daily reviews (overview)

    -   Schedule time for \"Organize and Process\"

    -   Schedule time for completing scheduled tasks (enter appointments
        with yourself in the calendar)

    -   Schedule time for completing unplanned tasks (leave room in the
        calendar)

-   Your day is planned - Then get an overview of the upcoming tasks and
    get going

**ProTip:** Your calendar day should NEVER be fully planned. 20% buffer
for unplanned tasks is a good rule of thumb.

**ProTip:** When you make appointments with others always plan **5 minutes
less** (e.g.: 25 instead of 30 minutes or 55 instead of 60 minutes)-

### Projects - Become like the kids (Kata)

_**Duration:** 60-180 minutes depending on reading speed, number of projects & project size_

Projects have their own definition in GTD. Anything that takes
**more than one step** to be completed AND that can be done within a year is called
a project. Projects are more complex tasks that run in sequence or in parallel. Therefore it is important to get an idea of the target state and to go through the whole project at the
beginning.

-   Read Chapter 3 und10 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things Done\".
    
-   Work through a new or existing project according to these rules and
    transfer the results to your GTD system.
    

In preparation for the following weeks, please schedule these
dates and appointment series in your calendar:

-   Once: 2-3 hours for Kata - Desk-Sweep

-   1-2 daily very short appointments (5-15 minutes) for \"Process and
    Organize\"

-   1 appointment weekly review (90-120 minutes), if not already done
    in the respective Kata

-   Collecting is done continuously or is part of the weekly review

### Work through the 5 phases (Kata)

_**Duration:** 120-240 minutes_

You have dealt intensively with the individual 5 phases of GTD in the
last 7 weeks. You\'ve got all the necessary materials, set up your
workplace, set up your individual system, prepared lists & contexts and
practiced the weekly review. And you know how to identify the next action.

Now in theory, you know everything you need to know to get the **whole
process going.** Every single phase in itself is important, but only as
a closed cycle the process will unfold its full potential for you.

You\'re ready! Starting this week, we\'ll get the whole system up and
running. Continue to work through the 5 phases of GTD this week.

**Initial - Desk Sweep**

-   Now you start to put everything around your workplace to a very
    simple exam. Take EVERY thing in your hand and ask The One Question:
    Can this be eliminated?

-   If so, dispose of it immediately, otherwise put it in your inbox.

-   Repeat this process until everything has gone through your slopes.
    Moreisnottodo.

-   Tip: Start locally (on the square) and expand your searches for
    stuff & things in a concentric way (desk surface, drawers, storage
    areas, cabinets, floors & shelves, etc.).

Then go through phases 1-5 iteratively again and again.

### The Power of the Next Step (Kata)

_**Duration:** 120-180 minutes depending on reading speed & number of projects_

According to David Allen the question "What is the next step?\"** is essential to generate measurable improvements in the process. This question forces clarity, responsibility, productivity and increased competence.

-   Read Chapters 11, 12 and 13 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things
    Done\".
    
-   To all the tasks that need to be done next in your lists add the context
    \@NextAction.

-   Ad the question **\"What is the next step?\" **into your daily
    routine.

Iterate the 5 phases again this week. If it works, keep going. If
it doesn\'t work, adapt your system.

**ProTip:** Consider whether you always want to add additional
attributes when creating a new task. E.g. time required or energy
required. This will help you decide in Phase 5 what is important NOW.

**ProTip:** If possible, always formulate your (project) tasks from the
result: \"The auto-inspection is carried out\", \"The project has been
accepted\", \"The board has decided X or Y\".

### The 6-horizon model (Kata)

_**Duration:** 60-180 minutes depending on reading speed & altitude_

A third model, besides the **\"Four Criteria\"** and the **\"Three
Steps\"** from the Kata \"Complete\", can help us to reflect our own
work even better. Assuming that we are proficient on levels 0-2
(actions, projects and areas of responsibility) through the consistent
application of our GTD system. We will focus now on levels 3-5 (future
factors, orientations and intentions).

We should do this regularly, but at least once a year.

-   Read Chapter 9 (The 6-Step Model) in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things Done\".
    
-   Start thinking about what goals you want to set for the next 1-2
    years. Write each idea down.

-   Then focus on a time horizon that is 3-5 years in the future. Where
    do you want to be then? Where will your company be? What external
    influences will directly or indirectly affect you? Write each idea down.
    
-   Finally consider what purpose your existence had and should have had
    in a time much further than 5 years in the future. Write each idea down.
    
-   Process the notes and decide if there\'s something you really,
    really want to get going. If not, dispose all ideas.

-   Decide on the ideas that are left over, what you want to do with it.
    Such as
-   Create a new project
    
-   Put on the list Some day / Maybe
    
-   Work out even more ideas for the future (with a partner or
        friend)
    
-   Share ideas with others and ask for feedback
    
-   Get professional help (e.g. coach)
    
-   Set up an appointment in your calendar (\< 12 months) on which you
    want to repeat this exercise

**ProTip:** For this exercise, look for a place where nothing doesn\'t bother you.

**ProTip:** Choose a time at which you have a lot of energy.

**ProTip:** Make sure you don\'t have a follow-up event to this exercise.

### Continuous Improvement - The Road to Mastery (Kata)

_**Duration:** 1-3 hours depending on reading speed & number of ideas_

We have already got to know and practice two of the three stages on the
way to the mastery in the last weeks. Applying the basics and the
6-horizon model. For experts focus, orientation and creativity are still
on the agenda. It is simply a matter of using the gained time to
endlessly optimize the experience.

-   Read Chapter 15 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things Done\".
    
-   Choose 1-3 ideas from the last Kata.

-   Continue to work out these ideas for concrete projects and tasks.

    -   What needs to be started now to fulfill the ideas and wishes in
        2-5 years?

    -   Discuss these ideas with people whose advice you value.

    -   Develop a network of new contacts that can help you achieve your
        goals.

-   Outsource more and more \"thinking\" to your GTD System

    -   Find an area you haven\'t captured in your GTD system yet.

    -   Integrate these areas into your GTD routines.

-   Set up an appointment in your calendar (\< 3 months) on which you
    want to repeat this exercise.

**ProTip:** The WOL Learning Path is the ideal support to help you build
a network of contacts that can help you achieve your goals.

**Stop talking, start doing!**

If you read through this guide but are not practising yet you should do so NOW! To start with lernOS is really easy. These five steps will help to start smoothly:

1. **Schedule Time:** define the quarter when you begin to use lernOS. Add the time-slots for  the weekly to your calendar. This regular meeting is of particular importance if you practice in a lernOS Circle.
1. **Define Objectives and Key Results:** use week 0 to define the objectives and the measurable results for the sprint. Choose an objective you really, really care about.
1. **Find a Circle:** look for 3-4 people who want to start a sprint in the same quarter. If someone has been in a circle before he can take the role of the "Circle Moderator".
1. **Organize the Weekly Meeting:** if you don't know each other meet face-to-face in week 0. Use social networks or instant messengers to communicate between the meetings. Use video conferencing tools to organize virtual meetings.
1. **Plan, Do, Learn, Repeat:** Use the last weekly meeting in week 12 to reflect the results and the collaboration in the circle. Decide if you want to run another sprint together.

Keep Calm & Learn On! :-)
