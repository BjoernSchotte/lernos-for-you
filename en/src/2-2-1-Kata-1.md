### Top 10 Sources of OKRs (Kata)

**Learn about the history and basics of Objectives & Key Results
(OKRs).**

_**Duration:** 60 minutes_

The history of OKRs goes back several decades. In 1975, John Doerr took
part in a training course at Intel in which Andy Grove explained the
theory of OKRs (book tip: [High Output
Management](https://amzn.to/2O9sA4u)). In 1999 John Doerr worked for the
venture capital company Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which had just
invested in the startup Google. That way the OKR method reached
Google. In the foreword of Doerr\'s book [Measure What Matters: OKRs:
The Simple Idea that Drives 10x Growth,](https://amzn.to/2XVI1Bv) Google
founder Larry Page describes the effect of OKRs as:

> OKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over. They\'ve
> helped make our crazily bold mission of \'organizing the world\'s
> information\' perhaps even achievable. They\'ve kept me and the rest
> of the company on time and on track when it mattered the most.
