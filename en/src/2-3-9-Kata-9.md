### The Power of the Next Step (Kata)

_**Duration:** 120-180 minutes depending on reading speed & number of projects_

According to David Allen the question "What is the next step?\"** is essential to generate measurable improvements in the process. This question forces clarity, responsibility, productivity and increased competence.

-   Read Chapters 11, 12 and 13 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things
    Done\".
    
-   To all the tasks that need to be done next in your lists add the context
    \@NextAction.

-   Ad the question **\"What is the next step?\" **into your daily
    routine.

Iterate the 5 phases again this week. If it works, keep going. If
it doesn\'t work, adapt your system.

**ProTip:** Consider whether you always want to add additional
attributes when creating a new task. E.g. time required or energy
required. This will help you decide in Phase 5 what is important NOW.

**ProTip:** If possible, always formulate your (project) tasks from the
result: \"The auto-inspection is carried out\", \"The project has been
accepted\", \"The board has decided X or Y\".
