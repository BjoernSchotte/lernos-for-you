### Perform your Weekly Check-In (Kata)

**Start with a short OKR Weekly Check-In each week**

_**Duration:** 30 minutes_

With the OKR Weekly Check-in you can see your goals and the current
state on a weekly basis. This helps you not to lose focus and to identify and remove obstacles early.

You have already set the time of your check-in and added it as a regular date
in the calendar. Use the following questions for the OKR Weekly Check-in:

-   **Progress:** What has changed in key results since the last Weekly?

-   **Trust:** How sure am I to achieve the key results?

-   **Barriers:** What hinders my progress?

-   **Next steps:** What can I do to improve progress?

Use the next four weeks to make the check-in a weekly routine. Every week,
you\'ll learn about additional topics around OKRs in a small 15-minute
learning nugget.
