### Review - The Weekly Review (Kata)

_**Duration:** 60-120 minutes depending on reading speed and deepening urge_

The review phase in GTD has a slightly different character than the
previous phases. It is mainly used to keep your system up to date and is
therefore the heart of the system. You will only be able to rely on your
system if you go through this phase regularly. In addition to regular brief views of your system, the weekly review is
at the heart of this phase.

-   Read Chapter 8 in David Allen\'s book \"How to Get Things Done\".
    
-   Find a suitable date for the weekly review and enter it as a repeating
    event in your calendar (1-2 hours should be already).

-   Run through the weekly review once for the last week

    1.  **Everything** in the inbox which you haven\'t put there until
        then

    2.  Empty the inbox

    3.  **See** through next steps

    4.  Browse through the dates (did To-Do\'s come out of it ?)

    5.  See through upcoming dates (are To-Do\'s included for you in
        preparation for the appointment?)

    6.  Check the **Waiting-for-list**

    7.  Browse the **list of projects**

    8.  **Mind Sweeping**

**ProTip:** To make the weekly review as pleasant as possible, connect
it to things that are pleasant and fun for you. For example, your
favorite drink, favorite place, favorite music or your favorite time.
